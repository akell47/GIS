#### Getting your Data House in Order

- 0.5% data is analyzed, 3% tagged and ready for use
- Gap between availability and exploitation - significant opportunity for business
- Big Data - 3Vs the *Volume* of data, *Variety* of types of data and the *Velocity* at which it is processed - make very difficult to manage
- *Small data*-  data in a volume and format that makes it accessible, informative and actionable
- *Dark Data* - the information assets organizations collect process and store during regular business activities, but generally fail to use for other purposes
- Re-Use of old technology - example windmills
- Use technology that already exists to add value to the organizations
- Intersection of Old & New - NOT Out with the Old and in with the New
- Re-purpose technology and data to get value out of it
- Growth Hacking finding innovative, inexpensive and often technical hacks to significantly boost a company's growth.
- Town Halls - reach out to see what they want. What can we do better to serve you? How would you like to use our data
- Employee Town Halls - how can IT help better serve your customers
  - no leadership invited - feedback will be more candid
  - what issues have been preventing you from providing for your customers - legal, political, social, budget <br>
- DNR - lot of geospatial data - Georgia Outdoor Map
- Large amount of budget spend on geospacial data development over the last 20 yrs. - Town Halls told us this data was needed but difficult to fine
- DNR created a reliable, convenient, easy-to-find way to access consolidated information about what services DNR provides in the state
- Brought disparate data sources and formats that were distributed across many screens into one correlated display method - Mobile Enabled

- Look around and see what data already exists
your organization has invested a lot in creating it
- It may have been created for a specific purpose, at or near end of life, in older formats
- What new uses could my customers utilize?
- Everything has beauty (data) but not everyone sees it
